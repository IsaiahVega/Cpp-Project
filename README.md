# 📌 COMP3800 Project – Course Management System in C++

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **C++ application** that determines which courses a Computer Science student can register for in the next academic term.  

It reads a text file containing student information, checks approved and currently enrolled courses, and outputs the list of **eligible courses** based on the curriculum sequence.  

The system supports the **four active curricula**:  
- **ASCS 2024-** (Associate until May 2024)  
- **ASCS 2024+** (Associate effective from August 2024)  
- **BSCS 2024-** (Bachelor until May 2024)  
- **BSCS 2024+** (Bachelor effective from August 2024)

## ⚙️ Features
- Reads student data from a `.txt` file.  
- Displays:  
  - Student name  
  - Program (ASCS/BSCS)  
  - Curriculum (2024-/2024+)  
  - Enrolled courses  
  - Approved courses  
- Determines courses the student can take next term (COMP, GEMA/MATH, Physics).  
- Optionally saves the results to an output file.  
- Fully compatible with **MS Visual Studio**.

## 📌 Technical Requirements
- The program must compile and run in **MS Visual Studio** (not Visual Studio Code).  
- Only instructions from the official *Introduction to Programming with C++* PDFs can be used.  
- No external libraries are allowed unless written approval is given by the professor.
